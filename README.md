# project-euler

This repositry hold solutions for project-euler problems. As of now I would try to foucs on writing the solutions in php. 

to run any of the solutions: 
In terminal from the project root dirtory run this command

```shell
php php/problem_n.php
```

where n is the problem id, e.g. for probelm 4 you would write:

```shell
php php/problem_4.php
```
